# Sampale-CV-Template
A sample CV template using HTML and CSS would consist of a webpage with a structured layout, using HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize the content, and CSS to style the layout and design elements such as font, color, and spacing. The template would likely include sections for personal information, education, work experience, skills, and references. The HTML and CSS code for the template could be customized to fit an individual's personal and professional information, and the design can be adjusted to match the individual's personal style or brand.
